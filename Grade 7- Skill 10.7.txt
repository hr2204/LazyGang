We know the area of the small rectangle, so we place that value next to $9$ since $9$ is smaller than $25.$

Then we multiply both sides of the equation by $81\ sq\ m$ to solve for the area of the large rectangle.

So the area of the larger rectangle is $225\ sq\ m.$

$\begin{array}{rcl}
&\left(\dfrac{5}{4}\right)^{2}\\

&\dfrac{25}{16} \\ \\

\dfrac{\text{Area of Large Quadrilateral}}{\text{Area of Small Quadrilateral}}&=&\dfrac{25}{16} \\

\dfrac{\text{A}}{96\ sq\ yd}&=&\dfrac{25}{16}\\

\color{red}96\ sq\ yd \times \color{black}\dfrac{\text{A}}{96\ sq\ yd}&=&\dfrac{25}{16}\ \color{red}\times\ 96\ sq\ yd \\

A&=&150\ sq\ yd
\end{array}$



To find the ratio of areas, we must square the ratio of side lengths.

Since $5^{2}=25$ and $4^{2}=16,$ the ratio between the two areas is $\dfrac{25}{16}.$

Then we can set up a proportion to solve for the area of the larger quadrilateral.

We know the area of the small quadrilateral, so we place that value next to $16$ since $16$ is smaller than $25.$

Then we multiply both sides of the equation by $96\ sq\ yd$ to solve for the area of the large quadrilateral.

So the area of the larger quadrilateral is $150\ sq\ yd.$
