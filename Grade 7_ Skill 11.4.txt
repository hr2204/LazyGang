$\pi$ is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. 

Since the circumference of a soccer ball is $69.1 \ cm,$ we put $69.1$ in the numerator of the ratio.

Since the diameter of a soccer ball is $22 \ cm,$ we put $22$ in the denominator of the ratio.

When we simplify the fraction using a calculator, we see that $\pi$ is approximately $3.14.$
