We are given the perimeter of a rectangular garden, so we start by writing the equation for the perimeter of a rectangle.

Substitute $30\ m$ for $P,$ the perimeter of the garden.  Since the width of the garden is $5$ meters less than the length, we can say that $w=\ell - 5\ m,$ so substitute $\ell - 5\ m$ for $w.$

Distribute $2$ to $\ell$ and $5\ m.$

Combine like terms.

Add $10\ m$ to both sides of the equation.

Divide both sides of the equation by $4.$

The length of the garden is $10$ meters.


We use $w= \ell - 5\ m$ and replace $\ell$ with $10\ m$ to solve for the width of the garden.

The width of the garden is $5$ meters.

We are given the perimeter of a rectangular picture frame, so we start by writing the equation for the perimeter of a rectangle.

Substitute $120\ in$ for $P,$ the perimeter of the picture frame.  Since the length of the picture frame is $10$ inches more than the width, we can say that $\ell=w+10\ in,$ so substitute $w+10\ in$ for $\ell.$

Distribute $2$ to $w$ and $10\ in.$

Combine like terms.

Subtract $20\ in$ from both sides of the equation.

Divide both sides of the equation by $4.$

The width of the playground is $25$ inches.


We use $\ell=w+10\ in$ and replace $w$ with $25\ in$ to solve for the length of the picture frame.
