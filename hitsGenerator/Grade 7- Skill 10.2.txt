10.2 PROGRAMMING INSTRUCTIONS
 Have buttons where they can select compass, ruler, or protractor. We will always provide the first line.

For the compass: First, a radius button appears and they select the radius (only using up and down arrows). Then have them click on a point (they can only click on a point that is on the page. A circle will NOT be created at a random click). 
Protractor: They will click on a point (just like compass) and a protractor will appear. They will be allowed to have more than one protractor on the page at a time
Line: They click on one point. When they move their mouse, they will see the extended line. When they click again, the second point will be plotted.

-All dots created need to be clickable.
-When they select “line”, they need to Click on one point and then they can drag the line to the second point..
-When we choose protractor and then line, the protractor does not go away so that the student is able to use it to create the line.
-I will label all diagrams the same so that when they plot the third point, we will always call it “C” (In other words, we need to place a label “C” next to the point.)
-When a student creates two lines that intersect, when they create the second line, a point will be created at their intersection..

10.2 Side-Side-Side (SSS) Triangle Constructions (Demo)
Create triangle $ABC$ where $AC = 6$ units, $AB = 7$ units, and $BC = 4$ units.
We are already given one side, so we need to use the remaining side lengths to create two more sides to make a triangle.

Since we are only given side lengths, we need to use the compass to help us make the two sides.

Start by clicking on the Compass button.

We will need to select the radius of the circle that we want to create.

So we choose to create a circle with a radius of $6$ units since side $AC$ needs to be $6$ units long.

Now we need to click on the location for the center of the circle. Since we are creating side $AC,$ we want to create our center at $A.$

We can see that we have created one circle with a radius of $6$ units.

To create side $BC = 4$ units, we need to follow the same steps to create a circle with a radius of $4$ units that is centered at $B.$

We see that the two circles intersect at one point above the given segment. That is where our remaining two sides will connect.

So we select Line, click on point $A,$ and then drag the line to the point of intersection, $C.$

Then we select Line, click on point $B,$ and then drag the line to the point of intersection, $C.$

Now we have made triangle $ABC$ by constructing three sides with the given lengths.

10.2 Side-Side-Side (SSS) Triangle Constructions (Demo)
Create a triangle with side lengths $6 \space km,$ $7 \space km,$ and $4 \space km.$
 Have a tool box where they can select compass, ruler, or protractor. We will always provide the first line.

For the compass, have them click on a point where they want to place the center of the compass. Concentric circles will automatically be created. Then they can click on the circle that they want to choose from all of the circles. We can either have the circle turn red or we can have the others disappear. The benefit of having the chosen circle turn red is that they can click a different circle if they make a mistake.
Ruler: Not sure if we need this. We can just have them create the lines by clicking two points
The protractor can slide around the screen, but they will still be able to create a line by clicking on 2 points.

-All dots created need to be clickable.
-When they select “line”, they need to Click on one point and then they can drag the line to the second point..
-If “dot” is selected, they should only be able to create one dot per problem. So, if the dot option is selected and they create a dot and then click another point, the original dot will disappear and the dot will appear in the new location.
-When we choose protractor and then line, the protractor does not go away so that the student is able to use it to create the line.
-I will label all diagrams the same so that when they plot the third point, we will always call it “C” (In other words, we need to place a label “C” next to the point.)
-If you create two lines that have a common point, that point is now 
-When a student selects “point”, and places the point at an intersection of two lines, the “extra” part of the lines will disappear.

Tool Tip: Fill in the blank and choose the proper units from the drop-down menu.

5: Unhighlight point A, show circle around point A






We are already given one side, so we need to use the remaining side lengths to create two more sides to make a triangle. Since we are only given side lengths, we need to use the compass to help us make the two sides.

Start by clicking on the Compass button.

We will need to select the radius of the circle that we want to create. So we choose to create a circle with a radius of $7$ units since side $AC$ needs to be $7$ units long.

Now we need to click on the location for the center of the circle. Since we are creating side $AC,$ we want to create our center at $A.$

We can see that we have created one circle with a radius of $7$ units.

10: Complete triangle ABC, all points back to normal color



We are already given one side, so we need to use the remaining side lengths to create two more sides to make a triangle. Since we are only given side lengths, we need to use the compass to help us make the two sides.

Start by clicking on the Compass button.

We will need to select the radius of the circle that we want to create. So we choose to create a circle with a radius of $4$ units since side $AC$ needs to be $4$ units long.

Now we need to click on the location for the center of the circle. Since we are creating side $AC,$ we want to create our center at $A.$

We can see that we have created one circle with a radius of $4$ units.

To create side $BC = 8$ units, we need to follow the same steps to create a circle with a radius of $8$ units that is centered at $B.$

We see that the two circles intersect at one point above the given segment. That is where our remaining two sides will connect.

So we select Line, click on point $A,$ and then drag the line to the point of intersection, $C.$

Then we select Line, click on point $B,$ and then drag the line to the point of intersection, $C.$

Now we have made triangle $ABC$ by constructing three sides with the given lengths.

To create side $BC = 5$ units, we need to follow the same steps to create a circle with a radius of $5$ units that is centered at $B.$

We see that the two circles intersect at one point above the given segment. That is where our remaining two sides will connect.

So we select Line, click on point $A,$ and then drag the line to the point of intersection, $C.$

We are already given one side, so we need to use the remaining side lengths to create two more sides to make a triangle. Since we are only given side lengths, we need to use the compass to help us make the two sides.

Start by clicking on the Compass button.

We will need to select the radius of the circle that we want to create. So we choose to create a circle with a radius of $2$ units since side $AC$ needs to be $2$ units long.

Now we need to click on the location for the center of the circle. Since we are creating side $AC,$ we want to create our center at $A.$

We can see that we have created one circle with a radius of $2$ units.

To create side $BC = 5$ units, we need to follow the same steps to create a circle with a radius of $5$ units that is centered at $B.$
