10.6 Creating Scales of Length (Demo #1)
When we multiply $2 \ cm$ by $3,$ we get $6 \ cm,$ so $x = 6\ cm.$

When we multiply $3 \ cm$ by $3,$ we get $9 \ cm,$ so $y = 9\ cm.$

Since the lengths of the blue triangle are larger than the lengths of the green triangle, the blue triangle is an enlargement of the green triangle.

We multiplied by $3$ to find the side lengths of the blue triangle, so the constant of proportionality is $3.$










The lengths of the green triangle are multiplied by $3$ to get the lengths of the blue triangle.
