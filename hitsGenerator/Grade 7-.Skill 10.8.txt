Frank and Judy hire an architect to draw the floor plans for their new home. The scale at the bottom of the floor plans shows that each inch on the drawing represents $4$ feet of the actual size of their new home.
10.8 Problem Solving: Determining Lengths and Areas Using Scales (Demo #1)
What is the width of the actual kitchen?
What is the length of the actual kitchen?
Since the scale in the floor plan is $1$ inch $=4$ feet, we need to multiply each inch on the floor plans by $4$ to find the actual dimensions of the kitchen. 

When we multiply $2$ by $4,$ we get $8,$ so the width of the kitchen is $8$ feet.

When we multiply $3$ by $4,$ we get $12,$ so the length of the kitchen is $12$ feet.

To find the ratio of areas, we must square the ratio of side lengths.

Since $1^2=1$ and $2^2=4,$ the ratio between the area of the scale drawing and the area of the actual house is $\dfrac{1\ sq\ in}{4\ sq\ ft}.$

Then we can set up a proportion to solve for the area of the actual patio floor.

The area of the patio floor in the scale drawing is $A=5\ in \times 6\ in = 30\ sq\ in,$ so we place that value next to $1\ sq\ in$ since $1\ sq\ in$ corresponds with the scale drawing.

Since $1^2=1$ and $3.5^2=12.25,$ the ratio between the area of the scale drawing and the area of the actual house is $\dfrac{1\ sq\ in}{12.25\ sq\ ft}.$
