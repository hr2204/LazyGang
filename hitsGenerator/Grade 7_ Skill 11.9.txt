The area of a square is $A=\ell \times w.$  The area of a triangle is $A=\dfrac{1}{2}(b \times h).$  

Substitute $15$ feet for both the length and width of the square.

The base of the triangle is the same as the width of the square, so substitute $15$ feet for the base of the triangle and $5$ feet for the height of the triangle.

$\begin{array}{rccccl}
\text{Area of Shaded Region}&=&\text{Area of Rectangle}&-&\text{Area of Square}\\

A&=&\ell \times w&-&\ell \times w\\

A&=&(5\ yd)(3\ yd)&-&\ell \times w
\end{array}$


To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the square from the area of the rectangle.

The area of both a rectangle and a square is $A=\ell \times w.$

Substitute $5$ yards for the length of the rectangle and $3$ yards for the width.



Tool Tip: Fill in the blank and choose the proper units from the drop-down menu.

A&=&\ell \times w&-&\ell \times w\\

A&=&(5\ yd)(3\ yd)&-&\ell \times w\\

A&=&(5\ yd)(3\ yd)&-&(1\ yd)(1\ yd)
\end{array}$


To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the square from the area of the rectangle.

The area of both a rectangle and a square is $A=\ell \times w.$

Substitute $5$ yards for the length of the rectangle and $3$ yards for the width.

Substitute $1$ yard for both the length and width of the square.

A&=&\ell \times w&-&\ell \times w\\

A&=&(5\ yd)(3\ yd)&-&\ell \times w\\

A&=&14\ sq\ yd
\end{array}$


To find the area of the shaded region, we need to subtract the area of the square from the area of the rectangle.

The area of both a rectangle and a square is $A=\ell \times w.$

Substitute $5$ yards for the length of the rectangle and $3$ yards for the width.

Substitute $1$ yard for both the length and width of the square.

So the area of the shaded region is $14$ square yards.
