To find the area of the bridge, we need to subtract the area of the two semicircles from the area of the rectangle.

The area of a rectangle is $A=\ell \times w.$  Since a semicircle is half of a circle, we divide the formula for the area of a circle by $2,$ which gives $A=\dfrac{\pi\ r^2}{2}.$  However, we need to multiply this formula by $2$ because two semicircles are removed from the bridge. Thus $\pi r^2$ is the area of both semicircles.

Substitute $320\ m$ and $100\ m$ for the length and width of the rectangle.

Substitute $3.14$ for $\pi$ and $80\ m$ for the radius of the semicircles.

The area of the bridge is $11,904$ square meters.
